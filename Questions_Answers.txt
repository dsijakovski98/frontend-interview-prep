    2. HTTP request/response?
        - HTTP request is a message from the client to the server, there are many types of HTTP request messages, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, UPDATE, PATCH etc
        - HTTP response is the message that the server sends back to the client in a reponse to a HTTP request.
        - Both HTTP request and response messages contain headers - key value pairs that contain some metadata about the message and optionally contain a body - the actual data being sent/received

    3. PUT vs PATCH vs POST?
        - HTTP PUT - creates a new resource on the server side, if such a resource already exists, it gets replaced by the new resource
        - HTTP PATCH - performs partial updates on a resource on the server side
        - HTTP POST - creates a new resource on the server side, it doesn't matter if such a resource already exists because this request will create a new one
